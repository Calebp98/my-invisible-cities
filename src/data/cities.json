    "text": "In Amarina, all houses face inward. Visitors stumbling upon the city see only windowless walls of weathered stone, arranged in concentric circles that spiral toward the center. The inhabitants insist this design arose from necessity - in the age of great winds, they say, only inward-facing homes could withstand the gales. But the winds ceased generations ago, and still the people of Amarina build each new structure with its back to the world, its windows and doors opening only onto interior courtyards and covered passages that lead, inevitably, toward the city's heart.\n\nThose who dwell in the outermost ring claim they can hear music drifting from the center, though none can agree on its nature - some speak of bells, others of strings, still others of voices raised in song. The residents of the middle rings report no music, but instead describe the scent of gardens they have never seen. And those few who live in the innermost circle say nothing at all about what lies at the center, changing the subject when asked, though visitors note they seem to walk with an air of perpetual anticipation, as if always on the verge of witnessing something remarkable.",

    "name": "Serafina",
    "text": "In Serafina, time moves at different speeds in different quarters. The western district races forward so quickly that buildings rise and crumble in the space of a week, while in the eastern quarter, a single sunset has been slowly bleeding into night for the past decade. The city's inhabitants have adapted to these temporal variations with remarkable ingenuity. Merchants in the swift-moving west construct their shops from paper and bamboo, knowing anything more permanent would be a waste. Meanwhile, the eastern residents have learned to speak in glacially slow tones that stretch single syllables across days.\n\nThe central market, where all temporal streams meet and mingle, requires the most delicate navigation. Vendors must carefully position their stalls along the gradient between fast and slow time. Those selling perishables cluster toward the swifter west, while dealers in antiques and heirlooms establish themselves in the slower east. The most skilled merchants can balance their wares precisely on the temporal boundaries, so that fresh bread remains warm for weeks while wine ages to perfection in minutes.",

    "name": "Chrysopolis",
    "text": "In Chrysopolis, memory takes physical form. Each significant moment in the city's history manifests as a crystalline growth that sprouts from walls and streets. Joy forms delicate spires of rose quartz, while moments of collective grief create deep pools of obsidian. The inhabitants have learned to read these mineral memories like a language, teaching their children to distinguish between the milky selenite of first loves and the sharp amethyst of hard-won victories.\n\nThe city's archives are not kept in books but in vast geological gardens where historians tend to the growing crystals, carefully pruning away false memories (recognized by their hollow centers) and protecting the most precious recollections from erosion. The oldest memories, those from the city's founding, have grown so large and complex that they have become entire buildings, their faceted halls refracting ancient light. Some say that if you stand in the right spot within these crystal palaces, you can catch glimpses of the city's future, glinting darkly in the countless mirrored surfaces.\n\nEach new generation adds its own layer of crystalline memories to the city's architecture, until the line between building and memory, between infrastructure and history, becomes impossible to distinguish. Visitors often ask what will happen when the weight of accumulated memories grows too heavy for the city to bear. The inhabitants of Chrysopolis only smile and point to the network of deep fissures that run beneath the city - channels carved by the slow dissolution of painful memories, making space for new joys to crystallize.",

The wealthiest citizens live in the highest towers, where the light is purest and heaviest, while in the lower streets people catch what falls, sifting through the day's remnants for fragments of dawn.\n\nThe city's famous light-weavers work in dark chambers, their fingers dancing as they pluck beams from the air and twist them into elaborate tapestries. These artisans are said to be able to tell a person's fortune by weighing their shadow. The city's central scales, massive golden instruments suspended between twin spires, measure the collective weight of each day's light, and the records are kept in ledgers bound in luminescent leather.",

A shop might be fifteen minutes from the square, but this measurement changes throughout the day as the city's temporal currents shift and eddy. The cartographers of Chronopolis draw their maps on clock faces, and visitors must learn to navigate by the position of the hands rather than compass points.\n\nThe most curious feature of Chronopolis is its markets, where merchants sell hours of youth, trade decades of memories, or auction off fragments of forgotten afternoons. The wealthy store time in crystalline hourglasses, saving it for moments of need, while the poor sometimes sell whole weeks of their lives to survive another month.",

They work through the night, when the fog is thickest and dreams are strongest, guiding the city's metamorphosis. Some say that Nebula isn't really a city at all, but rather the shared dream of all who believe they live there.",

The inhabitants themselves participate in this doubling - for every baker in the eastern half, there must be a baker in the west, making precisely the same loaves at precisely the same moments.\n\nThe city's mathematicians spend their lives calculating the exact point of balance, for if the symmetry is broken, they believe, the whole city might fold in upon itself like a collapsing paper fan. Visitors often note how the citizens of Symmetria move in coordinated pairs, their gestures matched across the dividing line, though no law requires this - it is simply the way of things in a city where balance is everything.",

Residents choose their homes based on the music they wish to wake to - a morning bird's song, perhaps, or the distant toll of temple bells. In times of trouble, the whole city can be made to ring like an enormous bell, though this is only done in the gravest emergencies, as each resonance ages the buildings by decades.",
