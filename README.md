# Invisible Cities

A digital journey through fantastical cities that exist only in imagination, inspired by Italo Calvino's novel "Invisible Cities."

## What is this?

This is a simple web app that lets you explore AI-imagined cities. Each city has its own story and a dreamlike illustration to go with it. Think of it as a modern take on Calvino's book—a collection of impossible places where memory crystallizes into buildings, time moves at different speeds in different neighborhoods, and light has physical weight.

The cities are fictional, whimsical, and entirely made up. The images are generated by AI, and the descriptions are written to evoke wonder and strangeness.

## Running it locally

You'll need Node.js installed. Then:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Navigate between cities using the arrow buttons, keyboard arrow keys, or by swiping on mobile.

## Generating new city images

If you want to generate images for cities that don't have them yet, there's a Python script that uses DALL-E:

```bash
# Set up a Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install openai requests

# Add your OpenAI API key to config.py
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-key-here'" > config.py

# Run the generator
python generate_city_images.py
```

The script will check which cities are missing images and generate them automatically.

*"The city, however, does not tell its past, but contains it like the lines of a hand."*
